# adapt-contrib-tutor  
    
**Tutor** is an *extension* bundled with the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework).  
It provides core [*question components*](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#question-components) with the ability to display feedback in a modal overlay. Feedback is configured in the individual *question components*, not in **Tutor**.

## Installation

As one of Adapt's *[core extensions](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#extensions),* **Tutor** is included with the [installation of the Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework#installation) and the [installation of the Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-Adapt-Origin).

* If **Tutor** has been uninstalled from the Adapt framework, it may be reinstalled.
With the [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli) installed, run the following from the command line:  
`adapt install adapt-contrib-tutor`

    Alternatively, this component can also be installed by adding the following line of code to the *adapt.json* file:  
    `"adapt-contrib-tutor": "*"`  
    Then running the command:  
    `adapt install`  
    (This second method will reinstall all plug-ins listed in *adapt.json*.)  

* If **Tutor** has been uninstalled from the Adapt authoring tool, it may be reinstalled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Plugin-Manager).  

## Settings  

**Tutor** has no attributes to configure.
