**PageNav** is a *presentation component* that adds basic navigation controls to a page

### When to use
Use **PageNav** as a replacement for the **Quicknav** component AND extension for both the Framework and the Authoring Tool going forwards.

## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **PageNav**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-pageNav/blob/master/example.json).

Navigation bar component which can contain some or all of the following buttons:

- _returnToPreviousLocation (takes you back to the previous location - not back in history, just the last routed location)
- _home (takes you back to top level menu)
- _up (takes you to the menu the next level up in the hierarchy)
- _previous (navigates directly to the previous page, if exists, without having to navigate via the menu)
- _next (navigates directly to the next page, if exists, without having to navigate via the menu)
- _sibling (1,2,3,4 etc buttons representing each sibling page)
- _close (closes the course window - only possible if the course was launched in a popup window)

The pageNav buttons will respect any [locking](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Locking-objects-with-'_isLocked'-and-'_lockType'#using-locking-with-menus) that has been configured in Adapt. In cases not covered by Adapt's locking system - such as a [start page](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Content-starts-with-course.json#example-1) that appears immediately before the main menu - the setting `_lockUntilPageComplete` can be used to disable the button until the current page has been completed.

### Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

**\_component** (string): This value must be: `pageNav`. (One word.)

**\_classes** (string): CSS class name to be applied to **PageNav**’s containing `div`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

**\_layout** (string): This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`.

**instruction** (string): This optional text appears above the component. It is frequently used to guide the learner’s interaction with the component.

**\_loopStyle** (string): Acceptable values are `allPages`, `siblings`, and `none`. `allPages` = loop sequentially through all pages in course. `siblings` = loop sequentially through all pages in current parent object. `none` = disable previous and next buttons at start and end of the pages in the current parent object.

**\_buttons** (object): The following attributes configure the defaults for the **Quickanv** buttons. These attributes are available on all of the following buttons **\_returnToPreviousLocation**, **\_previous**, **\_root**, **\_up**, **\_next**, **\_sibling**, and **\_close**.
